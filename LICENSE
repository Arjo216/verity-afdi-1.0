### **3. Setting Up GitHub Codespaces (Step-by-Step)**

Once the repo is created:

1.  **Click the green `<> Code` button.**
2.  **Click the "Codespaces" tab.**
3.  **Click "Create codespace on main."**
4.  Once the terminal opens at the bottom, follow the instructions from my previous response:
    * **Run the `sysctl` command** (Required for the database).
    * **Create the folders** as we discussed (`infrastructure`, `node_brain`, etc.).
    * **Paste the code** into the files.

### **A Pro-Tip for your Portfolio:**
When you share this project on LinkedIn or your Resume, **do not** say "I made a security app." 

**Say this:**
> "I pioneered a prototype for **VERITY**, an **AFDI (Autonomous Financial Defense Infrastructure)**. It integrates **Federated Learning** for private data collaboration and **Agentic Autonomy** for real-time threat remediation. It’s built to be **Quantum-Resistant** and **Privacy-First**."

**Would you like me to help you write the logic for the "Poison Pill" (where the Agent actually blocks a fake attack) once you have the system running?**
